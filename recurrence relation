To write a recurrence relation for the given algorithm, we consider the operation involved in each recursive call:

1.Allocation of memory for the extracted sentence: This operation occurs only once per call.
Copying characters from the original sentence to the extracted sentence: This operation iterates over each character from the start index to the end index.
We denote: (n) as the difference between the start and end indices (end - start)

 the recurrence relation:

T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)

Explanation:

T(n) represents the time complexity of extracting a sentence with a difference of n characters between the start and end indices.
The first term, T(n-1), represents the time taken to extract a sentence with (n-1) characters difference. This term accounts for the time taken for memory allocation.
The second term, O(1), accounts for the constant time taken for copying characters from the original sentence to the extracted sentence.
The base case of the recursion occurs when n = 0, i.e., when the start and end indices are the same.

Now, let's find the time complexity using the tracing tree method:


                      T(n)
                    /     \
               T(n-1)      O(1)
             /     \
        T(n-2)    O(1)
         /   \
       T(n-3) O(1)
        / \
     ...   O(1)
       \
      T(0) (base case)

In the tracing tree, each level represents a recursive call with a reduction of one character difference between the start and end indices. The algorithm stops when the difference becomes zero (base case). At each level, there is also a constant time operation of copying characters.

From the tracing tree, we can observe that there are n levels in total.

Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the difference between the start and end indices.
