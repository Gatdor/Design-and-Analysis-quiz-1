To efficiently perform the circular shift operation on a sorted array, we can utilize the concept of reversing portions of the array. The steps involved in the algorithm are as follows:

1. Calculate the effective shift amount by taking the modulo of `k` with the length of the array (`n`), as shifting by `n` positions results in the same array.
2. Reverse the entire array.
3. Reverse the first `k` elements.
4. Reverse the remaining `n - k` elements.

Here's the implementation of this algorithm in C, along with the recurrence relation and time complexity analysis:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to reverse elements of an array from start to end indices
void reverse(int arr[], int start, int end) {
    while (start < end) {
        int temp = arr[start];
        arr[start] = arr[end];
        arr[end] = temp;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}

// Function to perform circular shift on a sorted array
void circularShift(int arr[], int n, int k) {
    // Calculate effective shift amount
    k = k % n;

    // Reverse the entire array
    reverse(arr, 0, n - 1);
    // Reverse the first k elements
    reverse(arr, 0, k - 1);
    // Reverse the remaining n-k elements
    reverse(arr, k, n - 1);
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 15, 29, 35, 42};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
    int k = 2;

    printf("Original Array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    printf("\n");

    circularShift(arr, n, k);

    printf("Circularly Shifted Array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Recurrence Relation:
Let T(n) be the time taken to circularly shift an array of size n. The recurrence relation can be expressed as:
\[ T(n) = O(n) + T(n/2) \]

Time Complexity Analysis:
Using the iterative method to solve the recurrence relation, we have:
\[ T(n) = O(n) + T(n/2) \]
\[ = O(n) + O(n/2) + T(n/4) \]
\[ = O(n) + O(n/2) + O(n/4) + T(n/8) \]
\[ \vdots \]
\[ = O(n + n/2 + n/4 + \ldots + 1) \]

Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, this simplifies to:
\[ O(n) \]

Hence, the time complexity of the algorithm is  O(n)
